# Optimal-Portfolio-Allocation-using-Brute-Force-Dynamic-Programming
This repository contains the implementation of Optimal Portfolio Allocation, a project designed for the CSC311. The goal is to determine the best allocation of assets in an investment portfolio using two algorithmic approaches: 1- Brute Force Approach  2- Dynamic Programming Approach.

üèÜ Project Objectives

Develop a Java-based solution to maximize portfolio returns while maintaining risk constraints.
Implement and compare Brute Force and Dynamic Programming solutions.
Analyze time complexity and efficiency for different portfolio sizes.

üõ†Ô∏è Features

‚úî Reads input from a structured text file containing asset details (ID, expected return, risk level, and quantity).
‚úî Computes the optimal allocation of assets based on expected return and risk tolerance.
‚úî Outputs the allocation, expected portfolio return, and overall risk level.
‚úî Includes performance analysis comparing both algorithmic paradigms.
